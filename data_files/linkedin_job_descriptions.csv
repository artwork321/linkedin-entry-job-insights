3,"About Lyka:Lyka was founded in 2018 by Anna Podolsky, inspired by her dog, Lyka, who was suffering from chronic health issues despite being on ""premium"" kibble. Together with Gabriel Guedes (COO) and Dr. Matthew Muir (Integrative Veterinarian), they built Lyka from the ground up with one core belief: better food can radically improve a pet's healthspan and quality of life.

Lyka's meals are vet-formulated and gently cooked from real food ingredients. Delivered via a flexible subscription model, Lyka meals have driven remarkable improvements for tens of thousands of customers, supporting gut health, reducing intolerances, improving energy and mobility, and even promoting hair growth.

What began as home-cooked meals has since scaled into one of Australia's fastest-growing consumer companies, a vertically integrated, tech-enabled brand that is transforming pet health nationwide.

Lyka now operates from two offices, Sydney (HQ) and Melbourne, with three state-of-the-art food production facilities (two in Sydney, one in Melbourne) and a growing national footprint.

At Lyka, we're not just selling pet food—we're pioneering a new standard of wellness for pets. With strong product-market fit, deep customer love, and a track record of rapid growth, we're now entering our most ambitious chapter yet: building a generational brand and category-defining business with global impact.

The opportunity:As a Junior FP&A Analyst, you'll be part of the team that turns numbers into real business insight. One day you'll be working on gross margin models, helping the Manufacturing & Supply Chain team understand performance, and the next you'll be digging into data from our NSAW platform, learning how to spot trends and prepare reports that actually matter.

You won't just be crunching numbers in isolation — you'll be part of budgeting cycles, pulling everything together behind the scenes, checking accuracy, and making sure leaders have the clarity they need. You'll also get hands-on with tools like Planful, supporting stakeholders, troubleshooting issues, and building confidence in how financial systems work.

What makes this role exciting is the variety. You'll be jumping in on analytical projects, preparing datasets, creating first-cut reports, and building the kind of analysis that influences decisions across the business. On top of that, you'll have the chance to support process improvements — testing ideas, documenting changes, and spotting ways to make reporting faster and smarter.

And every month, you'll help shape the story of the business by contributing to the budget vs actuals reporting, pulling results together and drafting analysis that helps the team see the bigger picture.

Requirements

We're looking for someone who's curious about the numbers and eager to learn. Maybe you've studied Finance, Accounting, Economics, Data Analytics, or something similar, or you've already had some exposure to FP&A, financial analysis, or business/data analysis through work, internships, or uni projects. If you're in the early stages of your career and keen to grow, this could be the perfect next step.

You'll need to be comfortable in Excel, pivot tables, lookups, and the basics of financial modelling. If you've worked with large datasets before or dabbled in tools like Power BI, Tableau, Looker, or SQL, that's a bonus. Don't worry if you haven't, though. We value willingness to learn just as much as experience. Any exposure to ERP or budgeting tools (Planful, SAP, NetSuite, etc.) is a nice-to-have, but not a dealbreaker.

What matters most is how you approach the work. You've got an analytical mindset, an eye for detail, and you're not afraid to ask questions to really understand what's going on. You enjoy working with others, can explain your findings clearly, and you're adaptable enough to handle the pace of a growing business. Most importantly, you bring a proactive, growth mindset — ready to pick up new technical skills, expand your financial knowledge, and support the team along the way.

Benefits

- Work in a fast-growing start-up, experiencing what goes behind the scenes to sustain hyper-growth for a start-up with a physical product! 
- Growth and Development - Lyka is growing extremely quickly, which means you will have the opportunity to experience different challenges every day and progressively acquire more responsibilities as our facility and team expand. We provide an annual L&D budget for you to continue your personal development.  
- Work for a sustainability-focused company - we care about the health of our dogs and our planet. We're proud to be Australia's only carbon-negative and plastic-negative pet wellness company and we're always looking at ways for us to improve sustainability practices.  
- Be part of a diverse top-talent team, coming from widely different backgrounds and geographies.  
- Up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave top-up 
- Wellbeing assistance and tools to take care of your mental and physical wellbeing so you can do your best work 
- Pupper parent support to care for your furry friends - flexible arrangements for new pets, pet-friendly offices, discounts, and financial allowance for dog training and care to help them live their best life! 

We are committed to building inclusive and diverse teamsLyka is an equal-opportunity employer devoted to providing a working environment that embraces and values diversity and inclusion. We celebrate diversity, are devoted to creating an inclusive environment for all staff and encourage people of all backgrounds to apply. If you have any support or access requirements, we encourage you to advise us at the time of application."

52,"The Role 💻  We’re looking for a sports enthusiast, bettor, or trader who’s been independently developing their own models and strategies whether it’s for fantasy team selection or finding value in sports markets. If you’ve ever built your own models to beat the book, tracked obscure stats to test an angle, or spent hours tweaking code to squeeze out an extra percent of ROI, you’ll fit right in.  From building predictive models to identifying actionable insights, this role sits at the intersection of data, sport, and real-time decision-making. You’ll work closely with software engineers, traders, and product teams across time zones to develop data-driven features and tools that are fast, scalable, and smart.   This isn’t a back-office analytics gig — the role required being embedded in a product-focused team where the work impacts live systems, trading strategies, and customer experiences.

- A true passion for sports and markets - you love the grind as much as the wins. 
- Experience building your own predictive models (Python, R, or similar). 
- Solid foundations in statistics, and data analysis  
- Experience working with large datasets and querying databases (SQL/NoSQL)  
- Comfort working in cross-functional teams with engineers, product managers, and traders  
- Excellent problem-solving instincts and an eye for spotting signal in noise  
- Clear, concise communication skills — written and verbal  
- A degree (or equivalent experience) in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, or a related field  Bonus points if you’ve worked in high-velocity environments like finance, gaming, or sports analytics — or if you can explain a model and argue a referee decision.    --------------------------------    Why you’ll want to work with us👏  Regardless of the below perks, when you meet our team and see how we operate, and the rest are just bonuses.  
- Competitive salary with annual cash incentives and long-term incentive plans,  
- Birthday leave,  
- 4x Fluc No days annually,

The Mindrift platform, launched and powered by Toloka, connects domain experts with cutting-edge AI projects from innovative tech clients. Our mission is to unlock the potential of GenAI by tapping into real-world expertise from across the globe.

Who we're looking for:

We're looking for curious and intellectually proactive contributors, the kind of person who double-checks assumptions and plays devil's advocate.

Are you comfortable with ambiguity and complexity? Does an async, remote, flexible opportunity sound exciting? Would you like to learn how modern AI systems are tested and evaluated?

This is a flexible, project-based opportunity well-suited for:

- Analysts, researchers, or consultants with strong critical thinking skills
- Students (senior undergrads / grad students) looking for an intellectually interesting gig
- People open to a part-time and non-permanent opportunity

About the project:

We're on the hunt for QAs for autonomous AI agents for a new project focused on validating and improving complex task structures, policy logic, and agent evaluation frameworks. Throughout the project, you'll have to balance quality assurance, research, and logical problem-solving. This project opportunity is ideal for people who enjoy looking at systems holistically and thinking through scenarios, implications, and edge cases.

You do not need a coding background, but you must be curious, intellectually rigorous, and capable of evaluating the soundness and consistency of complex setups. If you've ever excelled in things like consulting, CHGK, Olympiads, case solving, or systems thinking — you might be a great fit.

What you'll be doing:

- Reviewing evaluation tasks and scenarios for logic, completeness, and realism
- Identifying inconsistencies, missing assumptions, or unclear decision points
- Helping define clear expected behaviors (gold standards) for AI agents
- Annotating cause-effect relationships, reasoning paths, and plausible alternatives
- Thinking through complex systems and policies as a human would to ensure agents are tested properly
- Working closely with QA, writers, or developers to suggest refinements or edge case coverage

How to get started:

Apply to this post, qualify, and get the chance to contribute to a project aligned with your skills, on your own schedule. Shape the future of AI while building tools that benefit everyone.

Requirements

- Excellent analytical thinking: Can reason about complex systems, scenarios, and logical implications
- Strong attention to detail: Can spot contradictions, ambiguities, and vague requirements
- Familiarity with structured data formats: Can read, not necessarily write JSON/YAML
- Can assess scenarios holistically: What's missing, what's unrealistic, what might break?
- Good communication and clear writing (in English) to document your findings. 

We also value applicants who have:

- Experience with policy evaluation, logic puzzles, case studies, or structured scenario design
- Background in consulting, academia, olympiads (e.g. logic/math/informatics), or research
- Exposure to LLMs, prompt engineering, or AI-generated content
- Familiarity with QA or test-case thinking (edge cases, failure modes, ""what could go wrong"")
- Some understanding of how scoring or evaluation works in agent testing (precision, coverage, etc.)

Benefits

- Get paid for your expertise, with rates that can go up to $38/hour depending on your skills, experience, and project needs
- Take part in a flexible, remote, freelance project that fits around your primary professional or academic commitments
- Participate in an advanced AI project and gain valuable experience to enhance your portfolio
- Influence how future AI models understand and communicate in your field of expertise"

Important Note: This is an unpaid internship. We don't cover accommodation, food, visa, or flights. What do we offer? The chance to build skills that don't exist in textbooks, work on projects that matter, and live like the future leader you're meant to be.

What You'll Do: Build AI systems that can find hidden patterns in massive datasets and transform raw information into strategic insights that drive critical business decisions.

Your work will influence how organizations make critical decisions, and you'll be creating the foundation for a more data-driven world where insights drive better outcomes.

Bali Option: Uncover global data insights from your island base, where the clarity of tropical skies mirrors the clarity of insights you'll extract from complex datasets. Mine datasets with a tropical focus, share breakthrough discoveries with your analytics crew over beachside dinners, and find inspiration for your algorithms in the natural patterns and relationships you observe in island ecosystems.

209,"IN A NUTSHELL

Our Demand and Supply Planning Team is responsible for keeping our inventory healthy across 6 parent warehouses, 10 child locations, and 4 global supply points. It's a complex ecosystem — and we’re looking for someone who can think clearly, plan precisely, and help connect the dots across teams.

Your mission? Maximise availability, minimise stock-holding, and shape demand and supply plans that align with factory capacity. But this role isn’t just about crunching numbers. Great planning here means keeping people aligned — from production to sales — and knowing when to flag issues, ask the right questions, or step in to keep things moving.

If you're someone who enjoys finding patterns, refining systems, and turning analysis into action, keep reading.

Role

You might come from inventory planning, or maybe you're in a data-rich role and wish you could see the real-world effects of your analysis. Either way, you're probably someone who enjoys:

- Working with large datasets and turning them into smart decisions
- Spotting gaps or risks before they become problems
- Streamlining systems and improving how things run
- Keeping others informed, aligned, and ready to act

Bring us your analytical mind, data-wrangling skills and desire for continuous improvement. In return, we’ll offer you a supportive team to bounce off, autonomy to get things done and the tools you need to do your thing.

YOU’D MAKE A GREAT DEMAND & SUPPLY PLANNER/ ANALYST IF YOU…

- Have 2+ years’ experience in a role where data, detail and decision-making meet (demand/ supply/ purchase planning experience is favourable)
- Possess strong spreadsheet skills and use them to spot patterns, optimise models, and automate processes (with SQL to connect and clean data)
- Have experience working across systems and are adept at cleaning or stitching together messy data to improve processes 
- Plan with care and notice when things are drifting off track, then act swiftly to correct them
- Enjoy collaborating with both technical and non-technical people
- Understand that analysis is only valuable when it empowers the business to act smarter
- Naturally bring clarity and coordination to cross-functional work
- Have used (or are keen to learn) tools like Netsuite (ERP) and Looker (BI tool)

IF YOU WERE HERE LAST WEEK, HERE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU MIGHT HAVE DONE...

- Built the demand forecast for new iPhone cases, which drove purchase orders and downstream shipment planning to hub warehouses
- Joined a wider Operations team session where the Logistics team shared their experience launching new luggage products in a relaxed, engaging way that sparked fresh ideas and collaboration
- Reviewed stock levels across our warehouses and created transfer orders to rebalance inventory
- Met with your team and our Chief Business Officer to talk through Inventory KPIs
- Worked with the Production Team to align a large supply plan to factory constraints
- Investigated a drop in Amazon Germany availability and implemented a fix
- Helped allocate inventory for an upcoming sales campaign
- Noticed a product selling faster than forecast, chased updated projections, and expedited a purchase order
- Flagged a manual process that could be automated, and worked with the Data Team to improve it

What You'll Get...

A team that’s thoughtful, collaborative, and deeply curious. Autonomy to do your best work. Tools that support you, not slow you down. And a role where your ideas won’t just sit in a deck — they’ll help shape what we do, every day.

LOCATION, HOURS & SALARY

This role is a full-time role based in our Collingwood office with WFH flexibility.
