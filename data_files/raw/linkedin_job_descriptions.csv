Who we're looking for:

We're looking for curious and intellectually proactive contributors, the kind of person who double-checks assumptions and plays devil's advocate.

Are you comfortable with ambiguity and complexity? Does an async, remote, flexible opportunity sound exciting? Would you like to learn how modern AI systems are tested and evaluated?

This is a flexible, project-based opportunity well-suited for:

- Analysts, researchers, or consultants with strong critical thinking skills
- Students (senior undergrads / grad students) looking for an intellectually interesting gig
- People open to a part-time and non-permanent opportunity

About the project:

We're on the hunt for QAs for autonomous AI agents for a new project focused on validating and improving complex task structures, policy logic, and agent evaluation frameworks. Throughout the project, you'll have to balance quality assurance, research, and logical problem-solving. This project opportunity is ideal for people who enjoy looking at systems holistically and thinking through scenarios, implications, and edge cases.

You do not need a coding background, but you must be curious, intellectually rigorous, and capable of evaluating the soundness and consistency of complex setups. If you've ever excelled in things like consulting, CHGK, Olympiads, case solving, or systems thinking — you might be a great fit.

What you'll be doing:

- Identifying inconsistencies, missing assumptions, or unclear decision points
- Helping define clear expected behaviors (gold standards) for AI agents
- Annotating cause-effect relationships, reasoning paths, and plausible alternatives
- Thinking through complex systems and policies as a human would to ensure agents are tested properly
- Working closely with QA, writers, or developers to suggest refinements or edge case coverage

How to get started:

Apply to this post, qualify, and get the chance to contribute to a project aligned with your skills, on your own schedule. Shape the future of AI while building tools that benefit everyone.

Requirements

- Excellent analytical thinking: Can reason about complex systems, scenarios, and logical implications
- Strong attention to detail: Can spot contradictions, ambiguities, and vague requirements
- Familiarity with structured data formats: Can read, not necessarily write JSON/YAML
- Can assess scenarios holistically: What's missing, what's unrealistic, what might break?
- Good communication and clear writing (in English) to document your findings. 

We also value applicants who have:

- Experience with policy evaluation, logic puzzles, case studies, or structured scenario design
- Background in consulting, academia, olympiads (e.g. logic/math/informatics), or research
- Exposure to LLMs, prompt engineering, or AI-generated content
- Familiarity with QA or test-case thinking (edge cases, failure modes, ""what could go wrong"")
- Some understanding of how scoring or evaluation works in agent testing (precision, coverage, etc.)

Benefits

- Get paid for your expertise, with rates that can go up to $38/hour depending on your skills, experience, and project needs
- Take part in a flexible, remote, freelance project that fits around your primary professional or academic commitments
- Participate in an advanced AI project and gain valuable experience to enhance your portfolio

As an Analyst in Middle Office, you'll be an integral part of the team responsible for regulatory reporting of BOQ’s Liquidity and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) exposures. Our team also manages the Asset Liability Management system (QRM), including model configuration and documentation. You'll work closely with the Manager, Treasury Middle Office, to develop reports that comply with BOQ policy and prudential regulators, ensuring all reporting is accurate and delivered on time as per regulatory requirements.

In this role, you'll be integral to daily liquidity and IRRBB reporting, as well as regulatory reporting of APS 117 and APS 210. You'll measure and monitor risk exposure against approved policies and risk appetite triggers and limits. Additionally, you'll handle daily data validation and system reconciliation to ensure data completeness and reporting accuracy.

Engaging with the broader Treasury, Market Risk, and Finance teams will be key to addressing data issues, identifying emerging risks, and ensuring they are appropriately configured in the reporting framework. Staying up to date with regulatory changes and capturing them in the reporting framework will also be part of your responsibilities.

You are part of the team that performs admin support for ALCO as needed and will build strong, productive working relationships with internal stakeholders across the Bank.

About You

To excel in this role, we're looking for someone with a blend of relevant experience and skills. Ideally, you have a background in Middle Office, Market Risk, Treasury, Financial Markets, or Product Control. A bachelor’s degree in Engineering, Finance, Mathematics, Economics, or a related field is essential. Experience in banking, finance, insurance and financial markets will be highly valued.

You should be proficient with spreadsheets, including macro and SQL writing abilities. Your quantitative, analytical, and problem-solving skills are crucial, as is your strong attention to detail, ensuring accuracy in all outputs. The ability to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders is important, along with competent writing skills for system documentation. Additionally, good time management skills are essential to ensure that tasks are completed efficiently, and deadlines are met.

We need someone who takes ownership and works well in teams of their responsibilities and has sound product knowledge. Experience with Value at Risk and scenario analysis is a plus, as is a solid understanding of APRA requirements related to APS117 and/or APS210. Additionally, you should have a good grasp of key business drivers and success factors to interpret P&L based on risk factors.

Finally, the ability to navigate ambiguity and engage stakeholders effectively and develop creative, commercially viable solutions to business problems will set you apart. You'll be supported by an experienced team in a collaborative environment that values flexibility.
